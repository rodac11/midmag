<h1 class="title">The Painting in the Hallway</h1>
<p>
One of my great aunts owns an Yves Gautier. I don't know how long she has had the painting, whether she inherited or bought it, and I don't know if she even knows who Yves Gautier was and what it means to have a Gautier, that a Gautier can easily be identified by the technique of its coloring, the distinctive concentric circles. No one in my family does. I certainly didn't know, until I went to college, obtained a degree that went nowhere, and went back to Robles. I went to visit my grandmother, who lives with my great aunt, and I passed by the painting of the three dogs that had hung in the same hallway of my great aunt's house for as long as I remember, and for the first time I recognized it as one of many Gautiers. <i>Three dogs</i> (so I've named it) might well be the ideal Gautier. It's almost excessively Gautier. It's as if all the other Gautiers (the ones that are known to the world, like <i>Sad Women</i>, <i>The Street Urchin</i>, <i>Rainfall</i>, and all the others) were nothing but practice, practice to get to <i>Three Dogs</i>.
</p>

<p>
Top left, I noticed Gautier's signature, which just reads "Paco."
</p>

<p>
Right after the moment of recognition I turned around to my grandmother and her sister. They were across the narrow hallway, making bundles out of stricks or straw and tying them with twine. They were both tall and gaunt, taller than any octogenarian had any right to be, but gaunt above anything else.
</p>

<p>
"Great aunt, what's with this painting?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you like it?" She replied from beyond the hallway, which divided the colonial house: "I painted it."
</p>

<p>
All my family is sick in the head.
</p>

<p>
I considered my great aunt as a petty and senseless liar, and things almost ended there. I stayed in Robles for two months to renew my residence then went back to Mexico City, where I found out one of my housemates &#x2013; the one I had asked to watch over my plants &#x2013; had left forever. No one from the house of eight had bothered to take over. I spent my first night rinsing the dust from the flowerpots. In the floor of my bedroom, circles of dust marked where the pots had been. I remembered the Gautierian circles, and <i>Three Dogs</i> had come back to my recent memory. You never know what bits of the past will end up meaning something. You don't know what you keep until you remember it.
</p>

<p>
There are more people living in Mexico City than there are citizens of Robles, even including the ones abroad. I like Mexico City; I like how many strangers there are. There's a café bar in Bucareli Street that plays good music and serves alcohol much earlier than all the other café bars. I go there to drink coffee and do my caligraphie and look at the art on the walls. There's a big mosaic made of letters from old printing presses. The letters are not arranged in any order, but close to the right age the word <i>swamp</i> pops out like a ransom letter.
</p>

<p>
I stay at the café until I can order mezcal. After four or five drinks I look up and the place is suddenly full of people, like they started existing then and there, after the third drink has gone to my head. Everyone looks worth talking to. That's when I ask for a coffee and stop working. I start thinking about my life. A lot of times I'm thinking about <i>Three Dogs.</i> When the coffee is done, it's time for me to go.
</p>

<p>
One night I had just finished my first mezcal when a woman offered to buy me a drink. She asked where I was from.
</p>

<p>
"What a coincidence!" She said, but I didn't think it had been.
</p>

<p>
She was from Robles, and I assume she heard me say something and realized my accent was Roblese. People from Robles are always looking for each other abroad; at least that's what I always say. We are all sick in the head.
</p>

<p>
She said her name was Aimé (a true Robles name) and introduced me to two friends who were not from Robles and whose names I've forgotten. She was from Contradicción, and I said I was from Oremos. Neither of us had been to the other's town. We had more drinks and talked about Robles and Roblese food, the lack of Roblese musicians. I wondered if we would talk about Gautier but he did not come up. Aimé's friends hardly said anything. For them it was enough to look at us with amused faces. This must be typical Aimé behavior, talking to anyone from Robles. She asked a lot of questions. It felt like I was bringing her news from home. Like there was something she wanted to hear from me.
</p>

<p>
When we left the bar everyone but Aimé flinched from the cold. The two friends said their goodbyes in between laughs. Aimé and I looked at each other. She started walking and I followed her. At first I thought we were just walking around the city. We walked faster in some spots and we slowed down in others. One time stopped walking completely. She was standing under one of the many lampposts. The light from the poles every ten meters or so reminded me of what you see when you stand between two mirrors, just one slice of space forever. We smiled like we remembered an inside joke. I realized she was older than me, but I could not tell by how much. I was twenty two.
</p>

<p>
Her room was covered in magazine cutouts and band posters. A stranger would have guessed the room was not hers, but mine. She turned off the lights and put on music. I didn't recognize the band and I was grateful of that. Every now and then she would laugh and wouldn't say why. When we were done she wanted to change the music and she left a nightlight on. Opposite the bed was a painting or a poster of some waves and two weird splotches around the middle. It bothered my eyes, like an optical illusion would, and I assumed it was because of the dim light.
</p>

<p>
She said she had fun and I agreed. Then she said she didn't do this very often and I didn't say anything. We held each other as we listened to the music. It wasn't music I would normally listen to, but I could see myself getting into it, if I made a point of getting into it. I told her so. She gave me her phone so I could put her number in it, so I did. I added her number to mine. Then she sat up and looked at me meaningfully and asked me if I would want to see her again, and I said yes. I meant it, too. Then she laid next to me again.
</p>

<p>
I wondered if she thought I was lying, and that many people would tell her that they wanted to see her again and then didn't. Maybe they meant it and then they changed their minds. Maybe I meant it right now, but then I wouldn't mean it later. But I really did mean it. Then I thought, and this was fun to think about, that Aimé didn't actually want to see me again, and this was a type of courtesy she was offering me. I was probably wrong about that one. I was sick in the head.
</p>

<p>
When I was putting on my shoes, I looked at the painting and figured it out. The waves had looked weird because the print was hung upside down. The weird splotches were the trunks of two dead palm trees on a beach. The trunks looked like graves, unmarked graves with meaning attached to them. I asked Aimé why she had hung the print upside down. She laughed and shook her head, as if that was a secret for another time, maybe for the second or third date. Typical Aimé.
</p>

<p>
I walked through the repeated lights of the lampposts. I thought about <i>Three Dogs</i> and I thought about <i>Two Dead Palm Trees</i> and about Yves Gautier and about my poor great aunt, and I also thought about the fate of the Roblese in exile, and about the fate of the displaced Roblese (two different things), and the strange fact of our French names. I thought about three dogs and two dead palm trees, not the paintings but the things themselves, the keys to all this. Gautier's life had a problem that was solved by painting three cloudy circles that only slightly look like dogs. The book of Aimé's life has a chapter that ends in the painting of a beach, with a footnote on why she hung it upside down. Now it was Thursday and I thought about that three plus two and felt sick. I was truly sick; aside from tired, with little money, and alone, I was sick. The fate of the Roblese.
</p>

<p>
That night, I fell asleep with my shoes on.
