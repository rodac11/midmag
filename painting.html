    One of my great aunts owns an Yves Gautier. I don't know how long she has had the painting, whether she inherited or bought it, and I don't know if she even knows who Yves Gautier was and what it means to have a Gautier, that a Gautier can easily be identified by the technique of its coloring, the distinctive concentric circles. No one in my family does. I certainly didn't know, until I went to college, obtained a degree that went nowhere, and returned to Robles. I went to visit my grandmother, who lives with my great aunt, and I passed by the painting of three dogs that had hung in the same hallway of my great aunt's house for as long as I remember, and for the first time I recognized it as one of many Gautiers. <i>Three dogs</i> (so I've named it) might well be the ideal Gautier; it's almost excessively Gautier. It's as if all the other Gautiers (the ones that are known to the world, like <i>Sad Women</i>, <i>The Street Urchin</i>, <i>Rainfall</i>, etc.) were nothing but practice, practice to get to <i>Three Dogs</i>. Huh.

    Right after the moment of recognition I turned around to my grandmother and her sister. They were across the narrow hallway, making bundles out of stricks or straw and tying them with twine. Christmas decoration, I suppose. They were both tall and gaunt, taller than any octogenarian had any right to be, but gaunt above anything else.

    "Great aunt, what's with this painting?" I asked.

    "Oh, do you like it?" She replied from beyond the hallway, which divided the colonial house. "I painted it."

    All my family is sick in the head.

    I qualified my great aunt as a petty and senseless liar and that might have been the end of it. I stayed in Robles for two more months to
