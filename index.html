<p>
  Welcome to our young mag.
</p>
<p>
<em>Mid Magazine</em> is an online and (soon to be!) print journal created in 2023. Our mission is to provide a platform for young artists to share their prose, poetry, and visual arts. We value work that is raw, energetic, and noncomfortist.

<p>
  Making stuff is difficult. Sharing it can be intimidating. Yet, creating and publishing art is easier than it has ever been. We can design, develop, and display beautiful work from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world, and we can do it on devices that weigh less than five pounds. That's less than two pineapples! So why is there still so much distance between artist and audience?
</p>
<p>
  To artists, being published feels like a means to an end, a foot in the door. We share our work in one place so we can share our work in other places. We constantly seek the recognition that comes from being seen, read, or heard, but we lose sight of who we are working for. We forget that the best art is the one that <em>means something</em> to others, not the one that adds to our portfolio.
</p>
<p>
  At <em>Mid</em>, we want to rethink things. We believe that published art should help build communities, not curricula. It should inspire others to create, not generate individual renown. Ultimately, art should be an <em>activity</em>, shared by many, that is worth doing and is worth celebrating.
</p>
<p>
  That's why we took a bottom-up, do-everything approach for our website and editorial work. We want to encourage others to just get started. There's a lot of exciting stuff that we could be doing, if we weren't waiting around for someone to give us permission to do it, or tell us that it's worth doing, or tell us that we're capable of doing it. We just have to do it! It doesn't even have to be good; it can be <em>Mid</em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We try to go by these principles:</strong>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Making art helps you. Sharing art helps many.</li>
<li>The easier the sharing, the better.</li>
<li>The best way to learn is by doing.</li>
<li>The best way to do is together.</li>
<li>Simple is good.</li>
</ol>
