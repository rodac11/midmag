<b>“We are all writing the same book, at the end of the day. And that same book, at the end of the day, is Nothing – in uppercase letters, that is, or maybe in lowercase.”</b>
— Roberto Bolaño
</p>

<p>
We're a place for writers to share their work and connect with others. We live in a world where art must be validated &#x2013; by peers, by the classroom, by the publishing world, and by the algorithm. But it doesn't have to be this way. Communication and sharing is easier now than ever before. You can plan, design, and publish beautiful work that can be shared across the world, and you can do it on a device that weighs less than five pounds. That's, like, two pineapples! We just have to take the initiative, and not take ourselves too seriously. The work can be <i>mid</i>. That's okay, that's a start.

<p>
We might look very thrown together and unprofessional, but that's part of the point. This might help explain things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Making art can help someone. Sharing art can help many.</li>
<li>The easier it is to share, the better.</li>
<li>The best way to learn is by doing.</li>
<li>The best way to do is together.</li>
<li>Simple is good.</li>
</ol>
