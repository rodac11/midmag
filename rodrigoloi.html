Last last Sunday the four of us went out for lunch at an Indian buffet. We had to take the bus and I was shaking from a hangover. Not long after filling our plates I mentioned an idea for my next book, an idea that actually went nowhere and most likely was not worth sharing, but it got the conversation started. You asked my why I don’t share what I write. First it felt like an intervention, then like a long overdue confession, and when we were done I felt almost as sick as before. Then I said to you, “this is what a thesis defense looks like,” which was not true because this had been worse. When we were done I also realized I had no good reason not to share what I write. It is the last night I am twenty-two and you got me to do this. Salud.

I thought of adding some lines about being hungover, of how instead of writing drunk and editing sober one should do both hungover, of how Spanish uses the same word after sneezing and before drinking. I have nothing to say about any of those, but, as I read somewhere, "if you have an idea and you publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done." So, there.

I also remember telling you that the most important thing an artist must be is brave. I got that from Roberto Bolaño, who says poets should have the bravery to know if they are cowardly or brave.

Let's end with Frost, translation mine:
</p>

<p>
Bello es el bosque, oscuro y profundo,
</p>

<p>
Pero tengo promesar por cumplir,
</p>

<p>
Y falta mucho antes de dormir,
</p>

<p>
Y falta mucho antes de dormir.
