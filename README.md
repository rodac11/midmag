# midmag
Mid Magazine is an open-source literary project created in 2023, by Rodrigo (owner of the repo). Mid Mag is a place where writers and poets can freely share their work with others, and where everyone can contribute everything: you can submit your original work in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry; you can suggest edits to submitted work; you can contribute art related to submitted work; you can contribute code to the website.
The project is meant to bring literature and open-source ideals together.

## Read Mid
The website is live [here](https://rodac11.github.io/midmag/), which you can browse as you would any website. If you want, you can also clone the repository browse it in your text reader of choice.

## Who Should Contribute
Everyone, in any way you'd like.

I strongly encourage anyone who feels unsure about sharing their work to submit it here. If anything, you'll get some experience working with editors (which is a good skill to have) and you'll have a website where you can send people to read your stuff.

I also encourage anyone who wants to contribute to open-source projects or just wants to do some light programming to also help out. The site is really bare-bones but it doesn't have to be.

## How to Contribute
There are two Google Forms for both submitting works and general inquiry. If you're familiar with GitHub, you can also make pull requests from there. If you're thinking of submitting, though, it's preferable to reach out first.

### Permissions Policy for Submissions
To maintain the tricky balance between 1) giving authors creative control over their work, 2) maintaining the spirit of open-source contribution and collaboration, and 3) ensuring that Mid has a fair standard of quality, our permission policy is as follows:
- All work is submitted to the editorial team (currently, that is just one person).
- If approved, editorial team might suggest edits, which the author can accept or decline.
- Before posting, the author can choose between an **open** permission or a **closed** permission.
  + **Open permission**: readers can make comments and suggest edits, which the author can then accept or deny. Mid Mag maintainers will then update the work as it is displayed accordingly.
  + **Closed permission**: the commonly known way of publishing. Once the work goes live, the version is final, and no changes are made (unless the author decides to make a change, or for clearly unintentional things like typos).
- A similar approach is used for any media related to the work, such as illustrations that could accompany the text.

### Permissions Policy for Edits
The authorial control over a work is to be respected at all times. No edits should be suggested for a work with a closed policy. Any suggested edits should make the best effort to elevate the work as it currently is, rather than trying to fundamentally change the work. Word choice, grammar fixes, and other line edits are valid. Suggesting a new ending or adding additional scenes is not.
